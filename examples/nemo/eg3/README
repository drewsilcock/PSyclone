This directory contains an example transformation script,
runme_openacc.py, that demonstrates the use of PSyclone to add OpenACC
Kernel, Parallel and Loop directives for the tra_adv.F90 code. Note,
the transformations are indicitive of what could be done and do not
produce correct parallel code.

Once you have installed PSyclone, this script may be run directly:

    $ ./runme_openacc.py

or may be used as a PSyclone optimisation script:

    $ psyclone -api nemo -s ./runme_openacc.py ../code/tra_adv.F90

In either case, the following will be output 1) the original code, 2)
the PSyclone invokes found in the code, 3) PSyclone's Schedule view of
the original code, 4) PSyclone's Schedule view of the code after
adding OpenACC Kernels directives, 5) PSyclone's Schedule view of the
code after adding OpenACC Kernels and Loop directives, 6) PSyclone's
Schedule view of the code after adding OpenACC Kernels, Loop and
Parallel directives, and 7) the transformed code with the OpenACC
directives added.

tra_adv.F90 is a stand-alone version of one of the tracer-advection
routines from the NEMO ocean model. It was originally extracted by
Silvia Mocavero of CMCC. The code can be found in the ../code
directory.
