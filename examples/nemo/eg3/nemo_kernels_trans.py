'''A transformation script that seeks to apply OpenACC DATA and KERNELS
directives to NEMO style code.  In order to use
it you must first install PSyclone. See README.md in the top-level
psyclone directory.

Once you have psyclone installed, this may be used by doing:

 $ psyclone -api nemo -s nemo_kernels_trans.py some_source_file.f90

This should produce a lot of output, ending with generated
Fortran. Note that the Fortran source files provided to PSyclone must
have already been preprocessed (if required).
