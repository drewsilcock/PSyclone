'''
This module provides support for extraction of code within a specified
invoke. The extracted code may be a single kernel, multiple occurrences of a
kernel in an invoke, nodes in an invoke or the entire invoke (extraction
applied to all Nodes).

There is currently only one class in this module: ExtractNode (see below).

Another class which contains helper functions for code extraction, such as
wrapping up settings for generating driver for the extracted code, will
be added in Issue #298.

class ExtractNode(Node):
    '''
    This class can be inserted into a Schedule to mark Nodes for \
    code extraction using the ExtractRegionTrans transformation. By \
    applying the transformation the Nodes marked for extraction become \
    children of an ExtractNode.
